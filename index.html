  <div id="story">Matt, a firefighter at his town, walks into his local diner for breakfast before heading to the station<br>"Matt!" A familiar voice calls out to him.<br>"Shannon!" Matt responds. "What are you doing here?"<br>"Can't I check up with my boyfriend?"<br>"I'm not complaining, I just figured you'd be at work or something."<br>"Well something came up. But first, take out your phone, go to ESPN livestream, Orioles vs. Yankees. Cedric Mullins hits a homerun... now"<br>"HOMERUN!" The ESPN commentator yells.<br>"How did you know that was gonna happen?" Matt asks.<br>"We're in a time loop, I can repeat time. I don't have enough energy to go any further back and I have to repeat the loop by sunset or I'm stuck in the present, but, it works. More importantly, this afternoon a fire breaks out in the forest by Pines road, 18 people die. We have to get there and stop it before it starts."<br>The two get into Matt's car and head towards Pines road. While in the car Shannon tells Matt, the driver, to take Jefferson out towards Maple road.<br>"49 is way faster." Matt responds.</div>
  <div class="question"; style="position: absolute; top: 500px;">Should they go Shannon's route, or should they take Matt's route?</div>

While they're driving, the wheel of a 2009 Lexus driving right in front of them falls off.

  <div id="story2">"No, we have to take Jefferson's out towards Maple road." Shannon repeats. "There's gonna be an accident on 49, loose tire... Take the next left, skip Kings. Water main broke, flooded the street."<br>After turning left they stop at a red light and a man, wearing beaten up, dirty clothes, approaches their car. He knocks on the window and Matt rolls it down to listen to him.<br>"Excuse me s-sir you have any loose change?"<br>"Sorry man I don't got any change on me." Matt responds.<br>"Are you sure, w-what about your windows? You need your windows washed?"</div>
  <div class="question"; id="question2"; style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute; top: 917px;">Should they give the man change, insist they can't, or drive away?</div>

  <div id="story3";>Suddenly, Shannon pushes down on Matt's leg subsequently pressing on the gas pedal, bringing the car through the red light.<br>"What are doing! Are you trying to get us killed?!" Matt yells at him.<br>"I'll explain while you fix the flat." Shannon responds.<br>The back left tire of the car pops, shaking the car. Matt pulls over they get out of the car to fix to replace the tire.<br>"You're freaking me out right now. How did you know the tire was gonna go out? How did you know about the accident? About the homerun? How did you know about any of it?!"<br>"It's all happened before. As I said, it's a time loop." Shane explains. "Change the tire." Shannon hands Matt the lug wrench.<br>"Okay..." Matt is silent for a moment. "Why does it seem like the world is agaisnt ever since we left that diner?" Matt asks.<br>"Because it is. Time, the world, they're like a master builder, an architect, and we're just a cog in their machine, another brick in their wall. They don't want us to get to out of their creation so they keep adding more traps, more obstacles to get what they want. 100 things will go wrong if it means we don't get to that fire, I have relived this day again and again, and not once have I been able to get to the fire with you." Shannon's watch beeps. "We got to go, finish that up." He says.<br>After finishing up with the spare tire, they get back into Matt's car and continue towards Pines road. After some driving they come up on a wooden roadblock being watched by a security guard.<br>The guard hollers at them from the roadblock. "Y'all need to turn back, sink hole up here. Took out the whole road."</div>
  <div class="question"; id="question3"; style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute; top: 1511px;";>What should they do?</div>

The guard just barely jumps out of the way before they hit the barricade. The car breaks through, but the collision is just enough to flip over the car. During the flip, Matt's head is slammed against the driver's window, breaking it and killing Matt in the process.<br>(click to reset loop)</div>

Matt barely swerves away from the guard and crashes into the road block while doing so. The road block flips the car killing Matt as his head slams into the driver's window.<br>(click to reset loop)</div>
  
  <div id="story4";>"Do you want me to gun it and try and break through the barricade?" Matt asks.<br>"No, when we do that the car flips and you die." Shannon responds.<br>"Really?"<br>"Yeah"<br>"Well what are we gonna do?"<br>"I'm gonna try something new." Shannon says as she exits the car. She walks over to the guard without saying anything.<br>"Did you hear what I said? The road is closed." The guard repeats.<br>Shannon continues walking and stops infront of the guard. "I saw the poster for your missing dog." She says.<br>"What?" The gaurd responds.<br>"I actually found him."<br>"My dog? Jasper?"<br>"Yeah, he's tied up infront of the downtown diner. I set out food and water which should keep him comfortable until you retrieve him."<br>"Okay... But how'd you even... You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you so much" The guard shakes hands with Shannon gets into his truck and leaves.<br>"Okay we're on foot from here." Shannon says. "I need the keys back."<br>Matt hands her the keys and they walk down the road.<br>"Alright, this is it." Shannon says as they approach three children gathered around a small campfire.<br>"Sorry about this, no fires today. Y'all shouldn't be out here by yourselves anyways" Matt says as he stomps out the small fire.<br>The campers apologize as they leave and Matt and Shannon look at each other.<br>"We did it." They say simultaneously.<br>"I'm glad you're here." Shannon says.<br>"You know this isn't really a fire that would've gotten out of control. There's a good perimeter, and there's-" A beeping interrupts Matt.<br>"What's that?" Shannon asks.<br>"It's my emergency pager... It says a fire broke out six blocks from the diner..." Matt looks around confused. "Why'd you bring me out here?"<br>Shannon hesitates for a moment. "When you stay downtown you die... We tried to stop the fire. Hundreds of times. We stopped the electrical fire, but another fire breaks out in the kitchen. We stop the kitchen fire, then a group of teenagers forget to put out a cigarette nextdoor. The fire always happens, you always die, and I always live. So instead I thought of another way away from the fire. I spent days looking for the shortest safe distance away. But there was always something that brought you back to the fire or killed you."<br>"Firemen don't run from fires..."<br>"I saved you this time!"<br>"I don't need you to save me Shannon."<br>"But I can create a timeloop that-"<br>"I don't care about timeloops Shannon!"<br>"If you don't care, then why'd you come?"<br>"Because I wanted to spend time with you."<br>Shannon looks around trying to make sense of it all.<br>"Give me the keys Shannon."<br>Shannon backs up.<br>"Give me the keys Shannon! People are dying!"<br>Shannon throws the keys away. Matt walks over to pick them up.</div>
