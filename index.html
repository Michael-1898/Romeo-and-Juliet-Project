  <div id="story">Matt, a firefighter at his town, walks into his local diner for breakfast before heading to the station<br>"Matt!" A familiar voice calls out.<br>"Shane!" Matt responds. "What are you doing here?"<br>"Can't check up with my brother?"<br>"I'm not complaining, I just figured you'd be on Mars or building a hover board or something. Wow, it's been like-"<br>"Four years, three months, twenty-one days. Go to ESPN livestream, Orioles vs. Yankees. Cedric Mullins hits a homerun... now"<br>"HOMERUN!" The ESPN commentator yells.<br>"How did you know that was gonna happen?" Matt asks.<br>"We're in a time loop, I can repeat time. I don't have enough energy to go any further back and I have to repeat the loop by sunset or I'm stuck in the present, but, it works. More importantly, this afternoon a fire breaks out in the forest by Pines road, 18 people die. We have to get there and stop it before it starts."<br>The two get into Matt's car and head towards Pines road. While in the car Shane tells Matt, the driver, to take Jefferson out towards Maple road.<br>"49 is way faster" Matt responds.</div>
